As you might know, SET has been brought down from Chrome Web Store a few months ago.

As first, I only brings it down to prepare for Chrome Extension Maintenance V3 update, but then I couldn't republish it due to some reasons:
* Maintenance V3 breaks the way how SET loads scripts
* Official stance of Starblast Main Discord is now prohibiting ANY client modifications regardless of its purposes.

I know that SET is always a non-hacking client, but due to my official position on the community, i have to drop it.

* And finally, I don't have enough motivation for this. Starblast hasn't updated for years, and I can't let myself
staying still anymore. So it's time for me to give up and go on.

But will it be the end of SET?
I don't know either.
